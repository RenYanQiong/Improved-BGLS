Improved-BGLS is a method based on Bayesian formalism for the generalised <br/> Lomb-Scargle periodogram
=======================================================================

This tool is written in Python (tested on Python 2.7).

The code contains the definition of the algorithm, takes as input arrays with a time series, a dataset and errors on those data, and returns rough predict period and best-fit period.

In order to run, it requires the following python packages:

    * numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
    * mpmath (http://mpmath.org/)
